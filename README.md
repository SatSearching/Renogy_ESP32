At the bottom of my garden, I have a small steel shed with 2 solar panels on the roof and a Renogy Rover 40A MPTT Charge Controller inside.
Also fitted to my fence are LED lights, I wanted a method to control the lights and read data from within the charge controller via the RS232 port.

I found the above project by wrybread" and decided to work from that, but using an ESP32 so that data can be displayed on my mobile phone via an internal site as below.
